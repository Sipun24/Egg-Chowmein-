First step 
To prepare, slice 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 an onion, and 3 green chilies on a cutting board. Then, slice a small head of cabbage, 1/2 a green pepper,1 medium-sized carrot, and a spring onion. Place these all on a plate and set aside.

Second step 
Begin by filling a medium-size sauce pan with water and place on medium-high heat until boiling. Once boiling, empty half a bag of chow mein noodles into the pan. Once the noodles are soft and tender, drain them in a strainer. Set the noodles aside.

Third step
In a medium-bowl, beat 3 eggs and season with salt and pepper. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a large pan. Place the pan on medium-heat. Add the beaten eggs to the pan and scramble. Once the eggs are cooked and scrambled, place them on a plate and set them aside.

Forth step
Using the same pan drizzle another tablespoon of oil. On medium-high heat, add the garlic, green chilies, and onion. Saute for about 1 minute then add the carrot, capsicum, and cabbage. Mix and saute for another 2-3 minutes.

Fifth Step
Add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, ketchup, and chili sauce. Add 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar and mix it well. Add the boiled noodles and mix it.
Tip: mixing is easier with to spatulas/wooden spoons. Once the noodles are mixed, add spring onion and scrambled eggs.
After it is all mixed, dish and serve!
